``strain_map.csv`` is a map that matches individual sequences from GenBank with the same sequences extracted from the XML.

``haplotype_IDs.csv`` gives each haplotype an ID (number from 1 to 99).

``haplotype_maps.csv`` identifies which haplotype was assigned to correct strains and which haplotype was assigned in the XML.
